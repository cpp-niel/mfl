## mathematical formula layout

A C++ library which computes the layout information for mathematical formulas provided in TeX-like syntax.

Given appropriate font information, *mfl* can take a formula given in TeX syntax like this:

`f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} \, dz`

and provide all the sizing and positioning details for the lines and glyphs that are
needed to render the formula like this:

## Design Goals

Turning a formula from a text representation (like the TeX input language) into beautifully
laid out lines and glyphs on some output device can be viewed as a four stage process:

1. parse the input text and generate an abstract representation of the formula
2. process the abstract formula representation, for example adding implicit spacing around
   operators
3. transform the abstract representation into a set of renderable elements with specific
   sizes and positions
4. render each element to the output device

*mfl* deals only with stages 1 to 3. It essentially offers a single function. The arguments
of this function are the textual representation of the formula and information about the
fonts that are to be used. The result of the function is a set of renderable elements. In
particular, *mfl* will provide exact information on what needs to be rendered where, but
does not have any support for actually rendering to output devices.

*mfl* attempts to support a useful subset of what is available to TeX users and to perform
layout in a manner that is visually pleasing and familiar. The [documentation](doc/features.md)
provides more details on what is supported and how to use *mfl*.

### Non goals

- *mfl* does not aim to support all features of any specific existing formula layout engine
- *mfl* does not aim to generate pixel perfect replicas of layouts generated by any specific
  existing formula layout engine

## Installation

Using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg):

```
    > vcpkg install mfl
```

Manual installation:

- Install CMake 3.14 or higher.
- The library itself has no third party dependencies. Earlier versions required [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt).
- For the tests, install the following packages so that CMake's `find_package` can find them:
    * [cairo](https://www.cairographics.org)
    * [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest)
    * [FreeType](https://www.freetype.org)
    * [HarfBuzz](http://harfbuzz.org/)
- Then at the command prompt in the mfl root directory:

```
    > mkdir build
    > cd build
    > cmake ..
```

## Usage

Using CMake:

```cmake
find_package(mfl CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE mfl::mfl)
```

## Thanks

The layout part of this library attempts to emulate the original TeX
layout algorithms reasonably closely. This is made possible by the work of Reinhold Heckmann and
Reinhard Wilhelm published in the paper [**A Functional Description of TeX's Formula Layout
**](https://www.rw.cdl.uni-saarland.de/people/heckmann/private/abstracts/neuform-review.html)
where they dissect the original algorithms and provide a very digestible overview of
the principles behind the layout of most formula elements.

### Third party libraries, fonts, tools and services

Many thanks to the authors and contributors of the following third party libraries, fonts,
tools and services with which *mfl* is developed, built and tested:

- [**fmt**](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) for text formatting (used in earlier versions, but now no longer needed)
- [**Clang**](https://clang.llvm.org) for compilation, standard library, static analysis, sanitizers and code formatting
- [**GCC**](https://gcc.gnu.org) for compilation, standard library
- [**CMake**](https://cmake.org) for build automation
- [**vcpkg**](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) for dependency management
- [**github**](https://github.com) for project hosting and continuous integration
- [**cpp_starter_project**](https://github.com/lefticus/cpp_starter_project) for project configuration guidance

The following are used during testing:

- [**doctest**](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) for unit testing
- [**Approval Tests for C++**](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp) for approval testing
- [**libFuzzer**](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) for fuzz testing
- [**stixfonts**](https://github.com/stipub/stixfonts) for the Open Type fonts used to test the library
- [**DejaVuFonts**](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io) for the monospace font used in approval testing
- [**HarfBuzz**](http://harfbuzz.org/) for access to extended font information when testing the library
- [**FreeType**](https://www.freetype.org) for font reading when testing the library
- [**cairo**](https://www.cairographics.org) for the rendering of svgs when testing the library
