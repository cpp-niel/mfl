**A C++ library which computes the layout information for mathematical formulas provided
in TeX-like syntax.**

Given appropriate font information *mfl* can take a formula given in TeX syntax, like this:

`f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} \, dz`

and provide all the sizing and positioning details for the lines and glyphs that are
needed to render the formula like this:

## Design Goals

Turning a formula from a text representation (like the TeX input language) into beautifully 
laid out lines and glyphs on some output device can be viewed as a four stage process:
1. parse the input text and generate an abstract representation of the formula
2. process the abstract formula representation, for example adding implicit spacing around
operators
3. transform the abstract representation into a set of renderable elements with specific
sizes and positions
4. render each element to the output device

*mfl* deals only with stages 1 to 3. It essentially offers a single function. The arguments
of this function are the textual representation of the formula and information about the
fonts that are to be used. The result of the function is a set of renderable elements. In
particular, *mfl* will provide exact information on what needs to be rendered where, but
does not have any support for actually rendering to output devices.

*mfl* attempts to support a useful subset of what is available to TeX users and to perform
layout in a manner that is visually pleasing and familiar. The documentation provides more
details on what is supported and how to use *mfl*.

### Non goals

- *mfl* does not aim to support everything available in some specific existing formula 
layout engine
- *mfl* does not aim to generate identical layouts to those generated by any specific 
existing formula layout engine

The layout part of this library attempts to emulate the original TeX 
layout algorithms reasonably closely. This is made possible by the work of Reinhold Heckmann and 
Reinhard Wilhelm published in the paper [**A Functional Description of TeX's Formula Layout**](https://www.rw.cdl.uni-saarland.de/people/heckmann/private/abstracts/neuform-review.html)
where they dissect the original algorithms and provide a very digestible overview of
the principles behind the layout of most formula elements.
